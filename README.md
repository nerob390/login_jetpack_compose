# Login App using Jetpack Compose, MVVM, Kotlin Coroutines, Retrofit, and Dagger-Hilt

This is a simple Android project demonstrating how to implement a login feature using Jetpack Compose, MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, Kotlin Coroutines, Retrofit for API calls, and Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection.

## Features

- **Splash Screen**: A simple login UI built with Jetpack Compose.
- **Login Screen**: A simple login UI built with Jetpack Compose.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Separates UI (View), business logic (ViewModel), and data (Model).
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: Asynchronous programming for network requests.
- **Retrofit**: For making network calls to authenticate the user.
- **Dagger-Hilt**: Dependency Injection for managing app dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio (Arctic Fox or later recommended)
- Kotlin 1.5 or later
- Minimum Android SDK: API 21 (Lollipop)

## Libraries & Technologies Used

- **Jetpack Compose** - Modern UI toolkit for building native UIs.
- **MVVM** - Architectural pattern for separating concerns.
- **Kotlin Coroutines** - Simplified concurrency and asynchronous programming.
- **Retrofit** - HTTP client for making network requests.
- **Dagger-Hilt** - Dependency injection framework for Android.
- **Coil** - For image loading (optional if you plan to add images).
- **Material Design** - For UI components (built-in with Jetpack Compose).

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nerob390/login_jetpack_compose
   cd login-app
